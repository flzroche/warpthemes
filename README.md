## What is "Warp Themes" ?

> This is an open-source repository with themes for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).

## What is this repo?

It's just my personal repository for creating themes; I don't often make my Git repository Public. It's kind of a practice.

## Requirement

- macOS
- zsh or bash
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) must be installed.

## Usage

```sh
./insThemes.sh
```

## Features

- Check that "[Warp](https://www.warp.dev)" is installed.
- Check that the directory “/home/user/.warp/themes” exists.
- After the above check,copy the files under the **"./themes/standard”** directory and copy the files under **"~/.warp/themes/standard"**.

**That's all!**
